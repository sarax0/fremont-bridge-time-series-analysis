# Time Series Analysis: Seattle Fremont Bridge Bicycle Counts 

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing time series data of bicycle counts on Seattleâ€™s Fremont Bridge. The data is collected from an automated bicycle counter installed in late 2012, which has inductive sensors on the east and west sidewalks of the bridge.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical bicycle counts recorded by the sensors on the Fremont Bridge. Each record typically includes the timestamp and the number of bicycles passing in each direction (eastbound and westbound). The dataset allows for the analysis of bicycle traffic patterns over time.

## Analysis
The Python code in this repository is designed to perform various time series analysis tasks on the Fremont Bridge bicycle counts dataset. Some of the key analyses include:
- Visualization of daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and seasonal trends in bicycle traffic.
- Identification of peak hours and peak days for bicycle usage.
  

## Dependencies
The code in this repository relies on the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
